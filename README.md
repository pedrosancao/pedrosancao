# Hello and welcome!

I love and enjoy web development. I'm a **Professional Full Stack
Developer** with more than 10 years of experience, expert in PHP
and Javascript with a Bachelor of Technology.

I'm on a full time job at Interaktiv - Oracle Silver Partner developing
health care related software for major hospitals in SÃ£o Paulo. Also I
do freelance jobs on UpWork.

I'm currently diving deep into Laravel and Vue.js.
